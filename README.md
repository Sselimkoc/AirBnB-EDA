Airbnb Data Cleaning and Analysis
This project involves the cleaning and analysis of Airbnb listing data to provide insights into various aspects like price distribution, neighborhood listing density, host activity, and more. The dataset used in this project is the Airbnb Open Data and is processed to remove missing values, handle outliers, and make the data more usable for analysis.

Project Overview
Data Cleaning:
Missing Data Handling: Missing values in several columns are handled with appropriate techniques, including filling with default values or imputation using the median.
Feature Engineering: Columns were standardized (e.g., renaming columns for consistency), and irrelevant or redundant features (such as country_code, house_rules, etc.) were removed.
Outlier Handling: Outliers in numerical features like price, service_fee, and construction_year were handled with boxplots and histograms.
Data Transformation: Conversion of data types (e.g., converting price and service_fee to float), and handling of categorical variables (e.g., transforming columns like host_identity_verified).
Data Analysis and Visualization:
Top Neighborhoods and Hosts: Insights into the neighborhoods with the most listings and the hosts with the most listings.
Price Distribution: Visualizations showing the distribution of prices and the factors influencing them, such as the neighborhood and room type.
Listing Density: Analysis of listing density by geographic location (latitude, longitude).
Libraries Used:
pandas for data manipulation
numpy for numerical operations
matplotlib and seaborn for visualizations
geocoder for reverse geocoding of latitude and longitude to neighborhood names
Dataset
The dataset used in this project is the Airbnb Open Data, which includes various columns related to Airbnb listings in New York City. Key columns include:

name: Listing name
host_name: Host's name
neighbourhood_group: Grouped neighborhood information
price: Listing price
latitude and longitude: Coordinates of the listing
number_of_reviews: Number of reviews for the listing
service_fee: Service fee associated with the listing
room_type: Type of room (e.g., entire home, shared room)
construction_year: Year the building was constructed
Features
Missing Data Handling: This project handles missing data through different strategies, including filling with default values for categorical columns and using the median for numerical columns.
Data Transformation: Column names are standardized, irrelevant columns are dropped, and data types are converted where necessary.
Geocoding: For rows with missing neighborhood data, latitude and longitude are used to reverse geocode and fill in neighborhood group information.
Data Visualizations: Several visualizations are included, such as:
Price distribution by room type and neighborhood group.
Number of listings by neighborhood and host.
Listing density on a map based on latitude and longitude.
